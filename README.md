# Card Collector


This is my take on crystal collector. On the right hand side are four cards. After the game is started
a random number between 19 and 120 will be generated in the box towards the bottom.
Underneath the four cards their is a randomly generated number which isn't visible. Each card is different.
Clicking a card will give a number between 1 and 12.
The goal of the user is to reach the randomly generated score which is displayed by "Score to reach:"
Doing so will result in a user win prompting an alert and win tally to increase by one. 
Going over will cause the user to lose and a prompt will notify the user and add one to the loss column.
